# PokeDex

## Objectives

In this task you will:

- ⌨️ use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` individually and/or in combination to return specified information about Pokemon from nested data. Installing libraries are not allowed.

## To Do

Write these methods:

- [ ] `findNames`: findNames should return an array of all the names of Pokemon in the data set.
- [ ] `findByResistance`: findByResistance should return all Pokemon that are resistant to the type of attack supplied as an argument.
- [ ] `findNamesByResistance`: findNamesByResistance should return an array of names only of Pokemon resistant to the type of attack passed in.
- [ ] `avgMaxCP`: avgMaxCP should return the average maximum CP (combat points) of all Pokemon. Remember that you need to divide by total pokemon to find the average. Be careful! Not all Pokemon have MaxCP!
- [ ] `countedWeaknesses`: countedWeaknesses should return an object with each type of weakness (that appears at least once) and a count of how many Pokemon have that weakness.
